## Intoduction
1.
My name is Dibin Jose. I am from Ernakulam. I have completed my MCA from FISAT, Angamally. I started coding when I was 17 years old and loves coding in JavaScript Language. During the corona lockdown  period, me and my 2 other friends started a edu-consultancy company called Conex365. Due to some financial reasons we were forced to shutdown the company after 1 year. But it gave me opportunity to get hands on experience on frontend technologies like bootstrap and backend technologies like nodejs, expressjs and mongodb.
I am also a blockchain enthusiast. My MCA main project was "Voting Based on Ethereum Blockchain" and I also took a seminar on "Stock Market based on Consortium Blockchain" during my MCA .
I also did an freelance work using Svelte JavaScript Framework

## The Real Stuff
1.
I have installed nodejs and npm for running js programs.
Since I use ubuntu, python is already installed. I had also installed some ML libraries which were required for my mini project.
MySql and Mongodb are also installed which accessed using terminal itself.
For doing my main project I had installed ganache for creating a local blockchain network and also
truffle.

    const n = num.toString()
    for(const i in n) {
        numberArray = [...numberArray, n[i]]
    }
    return numberArray
}

const result = fn(55)
console.log(result)
