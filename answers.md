## Intoduction
1.
My name is Dibin Jose. I am from Ernakulam. I have completed my MCA from FISAT, Angamally. I started coding when I was 17 years old and loves coding in JavaScript Language. During the corona lockdown  period, me and my 2 other friends started a edu-consultancy company called Conex365. Due to some financial reasons we were forced to shutdown the company after 1 year. But it gave me opportunity to get hands on experience on frontend technologies like bootstrap and backend technologies like nodejs, expressjs and mongodb.
I am also a blockchain enthusiast. My MCA main project was "Voting Based on Ethereum Blockchain" and I also took a seminar on "Stock Market based on Consortium Blockchain" during my MCA .
I also did an freelance work using Svelte JavaScript Framework
